========

There is no more intuitive cause-effect relationship for happiness, success and love than your degree of conviviality, being social \[1\]. If you care about things, it's only logical that you want to improve them too.

I'm dogfooding an app I built for keeping track of encounters and people, that I call **encountr**. A friend quipped to me that it was like CRM, which is kind of true. Encountr makes you better at managing relationships, but instead of a business- except it's about being a better person and communicator.

It's still in progress, I'd love some feedback. I'm continuously adding new features and little experiments. GPLv3 license until I take it private.
