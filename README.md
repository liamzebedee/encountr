Imagine if you could familiarise yourself with every person you ever met, genuinely. If you could exceed knowing 150 people (Dunbar's number) and achieve great things in doing so?

**encountr** is my app for keeping track of encounters and people. A friend quipped to me that it was like CRM, which is kind of true. Encountr makes you better at managing relationships, but instead of a business- except it's about being a better person and communicator.
