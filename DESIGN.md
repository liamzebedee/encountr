Practicing for my test on agile haha.

## user stories
All of this are as me.

 - I want to add people and tag them to a group so that I can find them with ease in the future.
 - I want search to be as fast as possible so that I can spend more time with these people.
 - I want to be able to search people with high accuracy, taking into account context, so I have no fear of adding lots of people.
 - I want the form filled out more easily.
