Practicing for my test on agile haha.

## user stories
All of this are as me.

 - I want to add people and tag them to a group so that I can find them with ease in the future.
 - I want search to be as fast as possible so that I can spend more time with these people.
 - I want to be able to search people with high accuracy, taking into account context, so I have no fear of adding lots of people.
 - I want the form filled out more easily.


 - As an indecisive person on how I'm going to use this application, I want to be able to retroactively add people to squads and modify them.
 		can the app do this automatically?
 		use the wordnet ontology to find similar groups.

you have different levels of specificity:
	groups
	encounters (with bunches of people)



organisations
how often people have switched	

-- just put this in the encounter notes
-- when searching, order automatically by most recent notes


Little bits:
 - get name from email
